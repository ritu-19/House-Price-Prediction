## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview
In this project, basic machine learning concepts are applied on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. 

First, Data Exploration is done to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
Second, Splitting the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
Third, Analyzing and Visualizing the performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. Fourth, Picing the optimal model.
Fifth, Finally, Testing the optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

## Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you\'ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients\' homes.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) (v2.7)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

## Project 

This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
